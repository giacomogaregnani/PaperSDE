STRUCTURE OF THE PAPER:

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
General introduction of the topic and of its motivation
1.1: Review of the interesting literature
1.2: Contributions, with a stress on robustness of the methodology wrt subsampling and to Bayesian techniques
1.3: Outline

SECTION 2: PROBLEM SETTING
Introduction of the multiscale SDE and brief overview of homogenization theory.
Explanation of bases of parameter estimation
Introduction of relevant assumptions
Negative result from Pavliotis Stuart (doing nothing doesn't work) + subsampling
Remark on higher dimensions

SECTION 3: THE FILTERING APPROACH (MAIN SECTION)
Introduction of the filter methodology, remark on computational complexity
Definition of the filtering-based estimator
Filtering with delta = 1, or delta = eps^power is different (see new Figure 1)

SUBSECTION 3.1: ERGODIC PROPERTIES
Existence of smooth density, geometric ergodicity and "magic formula" (proofs in Appendix A)

SUBSECTION 3.2: FILTERING AT THE SLOW SCALE	
Analysis of the case delta = eps^0 (= 1)
Based on multiscale convergence of the invariant measure of sect. 3.1 (Lemma 3.7) and on the "magic formula" on the homogenized measure (Corollary 3.8)
Theorem 3.9 (main result) - unbiasedness of the filtering-based estimator 
Remark 3.10 highlights what should be changed 

SUBSECTION 3.3: FILTERING AT FASTER SCALES
Analysis of the case delta = eps^zeta
The focus is on taking what's highlighted in Remark 3.10 and seeing how to fix it in case delta = eps^power
Main tool is Proposition 3.11, which shows that the difference between X and Z is given by a certain Brownian integral (B_t^\varepsilon)
Proof of Proposition 3.11 is quite lengthy and technical, so Appendix B is devoted to this 
Lemma 3.13 and Lemma 3.14 explain how to treat the problematic term with process B (same role that "magic formula" had for delta = 1)
Theorem 3.15 (main result) - unbiasedness of the filtering-based estimator for delta = eps^power

SECTION 4: THE BAYESIAN SETTING
Introduction about Bayesian for no pre-processing data
Theorem 4.1 - Negative result, if no pre-processing then posterior concentrates on drift coeff. of unhomogenized equation

SUBSECTION 4.1:
How to insert filtering approach: need to change slightly the estimator from $\hat A = -\tilde M^{-1} \tilde h$ to $\tilde A = -M^{-1} \tilde h$
Theorem 4.3: $\tilde A$ is still unbiased for delta = eps^power
Theorem 4.4: Modified posterior concentrates on drift coeff. of homogenized equation

SECTION 5: NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
5.1: Parameters of the filter
5.2: Multi-dimensional drift coefficient (more complex potential)
5.3: Bayesian approach: posterior concentrates on true parameter
